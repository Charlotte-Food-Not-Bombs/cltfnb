# Frequently Asked Questions

## Charlotte Food Not Bombs Basics

### What do we do?

We coordinate and host free community meals every other Sunday @ 5pm at [First Ward Park](https://g.co/kgs/RmdVfuQ). We also usually have clothes, reproductive health supplies, and other items that are regularly needed in our community.

### How do we coordinate?

We have a [Signal](https://signal.org/) chat that we coordinate meal logistics in that anyone can join once they have come to 2 meals.

### What is our chapter's food policy?

We serve vegan and vegetarian food. If non-vegan and/or non-vegetarian food is brought that would otherwise go to waste, we will accept it and serve it in a separate area if it does not require cooking to be distributed or shared with the community.

### What is our chapterâ€™s policy on masking?

Masking is required at CLT Food Not Bombs community meals - we mask to keep ourselves and our community safe in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

### What is our protocol for if police show up?

We will always have at least 2 community members trained in community defense and de-escalation at every community meal and those community members will interface with the police if that situation arises.

### What is security culture and how do we practice it?

[This](https://crimethinc.com/2009/06/25/towards-a-collective-security-culture) is a good resource that explains and motivates security culture as a practice. For us it generally manifests in our using aliases, communicating on encrypted channels, and sharing sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.
